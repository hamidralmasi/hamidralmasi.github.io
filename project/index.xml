      <title>Graph Models and Maximum Common Subgraph for Character Analysis</title>

      <description>An investigation into graph models within computer vision&amp;mdash;the project provides a criticism of existing general techniques reliant upon the Delaunay triangulation. I also propose and investigate techniques for modelling and recognition of characters, against several well-known handwritten datasets as well as a sampling of fonts.
The attached paper constitutes my Masters dissertation.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shallot implements a basic decentralised onion routing scheme designed for use within browser applications, by using a modification of the &lt;em&gt;Chord&lt;/em&gt; protocol as a backbone network and file-storage system.
This is built upon the experimental &lt;em&gt;WebRTC Data Channels&lt;/em&gt; recently added to browsers to offer true peer-to-peer connectivity between users.
The system is compatible with both NodeJS and browser-based environments, relying upon one server node as an entry-point.
Shallot was my Honours project&amp;mdash;the above link directs to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hamidralmasi.github.io/docs/shallot.pdf&#34;&gt;project dissertation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The end result of a team project, Sketch is a simple Swift-inspired programming language for drawing graphics and animations. Sketch is implemented as a JavaScript library, and is powered by an easy-to-use WebGL backend.
Unfortunately, no documentation for the language&amp;rsquo;s current version is available&amp;mdash;the implementation differs largely from the original design documents, although most language operations are shown in the test example.</description>
